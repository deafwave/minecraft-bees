## bees (MeatballCraft)

Automates bee breeding using the ComputerCraft mod. It integrates with multiple peripherals and systems to handle bee breeding, maintenance, and management. The script performs the following tasks:

- Maintains the advanced mutatron, mutagen producer, and industrial apiary.
- Finds unknown bees using the breeding chart and base bees configuration.
- Creates queens and finishes queens using the advanced mutatron.
- Processes queens in the industrial apiary.

The script runs in a continuous loop, ensuring that all tasks are performed regularly to keep the bee management system running smoothly.
